* About

These Android keyboard configuration files can be used to make your hardware keyboard act similar to what you get form the Neo2 keyboard layout (currently layer 1--4 only).


* Setup

The files contained here shall act as the key layout file and key character map file for the hardware keyboard where you want the Neo2 layout to work on. See .... for further details.

For me using Android 4.2 on a Asus Transformer Pad TF300T, a shell and busybox, this was something like:
$ su -
## My /system/bin/mount does not support `-o remount', so I use mount command from busybox.
# busybox mount -o remount,rw /system
# cp -ai /system/usr/keylayout/asusdec.kl /system/usr/keychars/asusdec.kcm backup-directory/
# cp asusdec_neo2.kl  /system/usr/keylayout/asusdec.kl
# cp asusdec_neo2.kcm /system/usr/keychars/asusdec.kcm

Make sure to replace the correct files, those that apply to your specific hardware keyboard.

After changing these keyboard configuration files, you need to reconnect your keyboard to make those changes apply. (I read somewhere on the internet you would need to reboot. It was never necessary in my case, but give it a try in case reconnecting the keyboard does not work for you.)


* Adaption

You will probably need to adapt the config files, esp. the .kl file, to your keyboard if it is something different than the Asus Transformer Pad TF300T mobile docking. Refer to the links to ... .android. ... given above.


* Open Points, Todos, Known Issues

The configuration works reasonably well, but is far from being accurate. AFAIK all keys work fine with "plain" Android apps, e.g. I get good Neo2 support when using DroidEdit. Some apps that seem to be more related to input system internals do provide most of the basic Neo2 features (alphanumeric and punctation characters, Layer 4 Enter and Tab) but lack support for many of the Neo2 Layer 4 control keys. (The regular control keys still work, but you have to leave 10-finger touch typing position to reach them :( ) This applies to e.g. Terminal Emulator, JS Terminal, VimTouch. Some apps cannot be used properly with these keyboard configuration files, e.g. the Emacs app does not get any punctation characters with this setup.


** Not (yet) supported features of Neo2

- Enter and Tab from Layer 4 works properly with most, but not with all apps.
- Control keys from Layer 4 do not work properly with some apps. (Layer 4 Backspace, Escape, cursor keys, Pos1/End, PageUp/PageDown, Forward Delete, Insert)
- Locking of modifier keys is not supported.
- Layer 5 and 6 not supported.


** Non-functional stuff

If seems to me the configuration itself would be a bit more robust and more flexible if it would make use of the meta and/or the symbol modifiers instead of rshift and maybe also instead of fn. I failed using the meta modifier as it always invoked some app on my system when pressing a key with the meta modifier active. The symbol modifier is mentioned in the ...., but I could not produce a valid configuration when using it and also did not find any example of someone else using it.

There are some more TODO comments is the keyboard configuration files ...
